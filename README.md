## Challenge 1: Currency Converter Application

### Video: https://youtu.be/2xaxccZh3kE

### Overview
A modern currency conversion application built with the following technologies:
- **Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Language**: Swift
- **Architecture**: MVC
- **API Integration**:
  - [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/)
  - [Exchange Rate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)

### Features
- Real-time currency conversion
- One-to-one currency conversion
- One-to-many currency conversion (limited to converting from EUR to other currencies due to free API restrictions)
- User-friendly interface with modern design
#### Note:
Due to the limitations of the free version of the API, the one-to-many conversion feature only supports converting from EUR to other currencies. However, the one-to-one conversion feature allows users to select any currency for conversion.
